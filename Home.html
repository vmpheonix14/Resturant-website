<h1> Pizza</h1>
<span>pizza, dish of Italian origin consisting of a flattened disk of bread dough topped with some 
combination of olive oil, oregano, tomato, olives, mozzarella or other cheese, and many other ingredients, 
baked quickly—usually, in a commercial setting, using a wood-fired oven heated to a very high temperature—and 
served hot.Uncover the chemistry behind the delicious taste of pizza

One of the simplest and most traditional pizzas is the Margherita, which is topped with 
tomatoes or tomato sauce, mozzarella, and basil. Popular legend relates that it was named for Queen 
Margherita, wife of Umberto I, who was said to have liked its mild fresh flavour and to have also noted that its topping colours—green, 
white, and red—were those of the Italian flag.</span>

<h1>Burger</h1>
<span>Burger King Corporation, restaurant company specializing in flame-broiled fast-food hamburgers.
 It is the second largest hamburger chain in the United States, after McDonald’s, and one of the 
 most successful brands in fast-food history. In the early 21st century, Burger King claimed to 
 have about 14,000 stores in nearly 100 countries. Headquarters are in Miami, Florida. 
 According to the company, Burger King was started in 1954 by James W. 
 McLamore and David Edgerton in Miami. Other sources, however, trace Burger King back to Insta-Burger King, 
 a venture founded in Jacksonville, Florida, by Keith Kramer and Matthew Burns in 1953. 
 McLamore and Edgerton sold their first franchises in 1959, and Burger King soon became a national chain. </span>
